Troubleshooting notes:


1)  Error message:
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: Failed to access the WSDL at: https://ejbca.course:8443/ejbca/ejbcaws/ejbcaws?wsdl. It failed with: 
	Operation timed out.
This means that the appserver isn't accessible; it may not be running or the url (eg, ejbca.course:8443) may be incorrect.



2)  If the option is made to generate the end entity's certificate (instead of just adding the new end entity to the EJBCA database),
then the end entity profile needs to have "Batch generation (clear text pwd storage) use" checkbox selected.
 

 
3)  Make sure that the appriopriate access rules are marked as "Accept" in the admin web page interface (System Functions | Edit Administrator Privileges | Access Rules)
including the access rules for the selected end entity profile.
See the Admin Guide 
	https://ejbca.course:8443/ejbca/doc/adminguide.html#Accessrules%20required%20when%20using%20the%20Web%20Service%20API
or the Interface EjbcaWS section of the EJBCA Web Service API Reference
	https://ejbca.course:8443/ejbca/doc/ws/index.html
for more information on the access rules needed by the web service API.	



4)  The UI only exposes a subset of available DN fields.  If the end entity profile selected requires fields to be set that are not available in this UI,
or if an available field is filled in but is not marked as "use" in the end entity profile, then an exception will be reported
when attempting to create the new item.
  
  
 
5)  If you are encountering problems using the send email notification functionality:

Make sure that the appserver is configured correctly for sending mail.
Note that this has nothing to do with whether or not the sendmail service is running on the server.

If the appserver is jboss, the settings for sending email can be found in the
	jboss/server/default/deploy/ejbca-mail-service.xml file.
In particular, check that the smtp, user and pw settings are correct.
Try enabling the mail.debug property in the xml file for more info.

Check that the end entity profile settings for mail notifications are correct:
	a) "Send Notification Use" should be checked;
	b) the email address for "Notification Sender" should be set to something meaningful that indicates it is coming from the CA;
	c) the "Notification Recipient" should be set to "USER";
	d) the selection of "Notification Events" should include "STATUSNEW";
	e) if this notification is being used to indicate to a user that he needs to go to the public web page interface to create a certificate or keystore,
	and if the email delivery is deemed secure,
	then the "Notification Message" could indicate the password for the newly added user.
	See the section on
	"Dynamic Substitution Variables" under "Email notifications" in the EJBCA Admin Guide; in particular your message may
	include the ${USERNAME}, ${PASSWORD}, and instructions on creating the certificate (such as the url of the public web page interface). 
 
Also, is an email address in the Subject DN field enabled in the end entity profile, and is the value provided for the current user correct?

Check firewall issues affecting the sending of email.

5a) If you get the following exception:
	org.ejbca.core.protocol.ws.client.gen.UserDoesntFullfillEndEntityProfile_Exception: Email notification cannot be used.
then you probably have the "Send Email Notification" checkbox selected in the client application but the actual end entity profile does not have the Use checkbox selected for "Send Notification".
  

  
General tips:
 
1)  Make sure that the date/time of the appserver is correct.
For example, if this is a test or learning system that you are running in a VM, it will almost certainly not have the correct time if you pause and restart the VM.
On Linux, run "date" to see the current date time; you can also use date (as su) to set the correct time.


2)  Make sure that the hostname set for the appserver is recognized on your client machine (set it in the hosts file if necessary).
The server expects requests to be made through the value set in the EJBCA/conf/web.properties file for httpsserver.hostname.


3)  Bug (3.10):  When editing an end entity profile in the admin web page interface, previously saved send notification settings (recipient and message) cannot be changed.
The workaround is to add a new send notification, copy the previous settings, and then modify them.
