UPGRADE
=======

This document describes procedures needed to upgrade from one 
version of External RA to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 for example, are 
usually plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new 
software. See doc/RELEASE_NOTES for info about such upgrades.

From ExtRA 3.9.x to ExtRA 3.10.x
--------------------------------
From EJBCA 3.10, the External RA is part of the main EJBCA bundle. Please refer to the EJBCA
documentation for more information. 

From ExtRA 3.8.x to ExtRA 3.9.x
-------------------------------
In 3.9.x the External RA CA service, running on the CA host, has changed dramatically.
It is no longer a JBoss specific MBean, but is implemented in the generic EJBCA service framework.

To upgrade to ExtRA 3.9.x on EJBCA 3.9.x:

1. Remove all traces of External RA from the CA host.
   rm JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/extrajbosshibernite.har
   rm JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/extracajbossservice.jar
   rm JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/ramessage-ds.xml

2. Follow the installation instructions for ExtRA 3.9.x.

On the external RA host installation is basically the same as usual. 
It is on the CA host where the large changes have been made.
