    <p>
    EJBCA is an open source project and appreciates community contributions:
    <ul>
    <li>Contribute code - we love patches! If you have a new feature or bug-fix, this is the absolute fastest way get it implemented.<br/>
        A well written feature or bug-fix with proper JUnit tests have a very high probability of living on,
        thus removing the maintenance burden of patching EJBCA every time you upgrade.</li>
    <li>Contribute documentation. Documentation can always be improved.</li>
    <li>Contribute translations. Translations can always be improved.</li>
    <li>Report bugs, suggest new features and improvements. You can do it all through the <a href="https://jira.primekey.se/">Issue Tracker</a>.</li>
    <li>Join the EJBCA Team!</li>
    <li>Due to Common Criteria certification we can not be very generous with SVN commit access. We may get SVN access if you prove yourself, have long-term intentions and sign of on our Development Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    See <a href="contact.html">contact &amp; support</a> for ways to contact the EJBCA Team.

  <section name="Contributor Policy">
  <p>We want to make EJBCA community friendly, yet secure and respectable. We therefore have a simple contributor policy. If you submit patches to EJBCA 
  you should comply with this simple policy.</p>

<ul>
<li>As the author of the contribution, you retain your copyright as is;</li>

<section name="How to Contribute">
<p>
If you are not a committer in SVN we are glad to accept patches. You can send us patches either
in diff format (svn diff) or created with an IDE.
You can also send us complete files that you have changed, we can see the diffs in our IDE.
</p>
<p>
The normal process for contribution patches is: 
<ul>
<li>Contributor send patches, under the LGPLv2.1+ license, to the ejbca-develop mailing list, or directly to PrimeKey.</li>
<li>Include a JUnit test case for your change, it may be a simple addition to an existing test. If you do not know how to do this, ask us and we will help you.</li>
<li>Someone on the EJBCA core team will review them, when there is time, and if needed suggest improvements.</li>
<li>If it is a useful and generic feature it will be integrated in EJBCA to be available in a later release.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please follow these simple guidelines when submitting patches:
</p>
<p>
    Keep the patch limited, only change the parts related to your patch.
    Do not change other lines, such as whitespace, adding line breaks to java doc etc. It will make it very very hard for us to review the patch.
</p>

Contributors are asked if they want to have their name and optional contact information listed on the contributors page.

<section name="Getting Started with EJBCA development">
<subsection name="Development Tools">
<ul>
<li>An operating system that can run Java (Linux, OSX, Windows..). Most developers use Ubuntu/Debian.</li>
<li>Eclipse JEE edition with an additional Subversion (SVN) plugin installed.</li>
<li>OpenJDK 8, or OracleJDK 8, or later</li>
<li>Apache Ant 1.9.x (with all the extras that comes with the zip from apache.org or 'ant-optional' Ubuntu package)</li>
<li>A supported application server (WildFly 9, JBoss EAP, JBoss AS 7.1.1.GA, etc)</li>
<li>A favorite database supported by EJBCA that is easy to work with (H2, MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.).</li>
<li>A virtualization solution for testing additional combinations of application servers and databases and external OCSP responders etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Changes that affect the database requires more databases to test with, changes that affect the EJBs or setup requires additional application servers etc..
What you need to know to develop EJBCA
