TODO for PKI Tools

Immediate tasks:

- chaining of certs

In no particular order (but the easy stuff is first)

- move the code from CertificateTool into junit tests; right now that and the scripts/build.xml
	 file serve as a test environment
- update documentation from EJBCA documentation where available
- Retreive the password via a callback handler and write a sample callback handler
- make configurable to work with any provider
- put in apache commons logging with a default log4j logging  
- implement a signer factory to and related classes to provide a uniform mechanism for signing using different algorithims
	(only RSA at first)
