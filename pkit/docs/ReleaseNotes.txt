pkit  (PKI Tools)  Release notes

pkit is essentially a hack of code from EJBCA ( http://ejbca.sourceforge.net ) and relies heavily
on the good work of Tomas Gustavsson and others from from EJBCA.   I have simply de-EJB'ed their code 
and produced some classes that I hope, with the help of others ( you :-) ) to grow in to a useful, friendly and well written
API to abstract the complexity of X509 and related PKI requirements and specifications.   I also hope to de-mystify 
PKI and make it less of a 'dark art' and so I aim to add a lot of documentation and references.   

Currently you will be able to use PKIT to:

- sign a cert to produce a well formed cert for various usages
- create a keystore (any format for which you have a provider) with an initial private key and self cert 
- create certificate signing requests (CSRs)
- received responses from CSR's into the keystore
- convert keystores with simple content from one format to another as long as you have providers for the formats
- produce blank CRLs (yes, only blank :-) )
- a number of other useful PKI related tasks

An example commandline utiltiy is included which shows complete certificate cycle from the generation of a client keystore 
to the receipt of signed cert.

A note on scripts

I initially started out with the intention of writing shell scripts and batch files to run the examples,
but now I have settled on ant for doing all that.

EJBCA and pkit
Since pkit's code is in different module to EJBCA it willl not always do all that EJBCA's signer now does, since 
work continues on EJBCA independantly.   I will occassionally synch pkit with some of the newer code if required
or I have the time.
