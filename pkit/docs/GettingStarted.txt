Assuming you have your java environment and ant installed

if you downloaded pkit-noprov.tgz ...
	You still need the bouncy castle provider jar copy yours into pkit's lib directory or download one to there from
	www.bouncycastle.org

To build from source ...
	run ant target "all"

To see what pkit can do ...
	Take a look at the ant build file build.xml in the scripts directory.   From there you can run most of the 
	functionality.

To see how to use pkit in your own code ...
	Take a look at the CertificateTool class to see how it's done

To actually use pkit ...
	Type this at the commandline from the pkit home directory
		java -cp ./lib/bcprov-jdk14-115.jar:./lib/ca.jar:./lib/log4j-1.2.jar:./dist/pkit.jar pkit.examples.CertificateTool
	to print usage information
