pkit  (PKI Tools)

pkit is essentially a hack of code from EJBCA ( http://ejbca.sourceforge.net ) and relies heavily
on the good work of Tomas Gustavsson and others from from EJBCA.   I have simply de-EJB'ed their code 
and produced some classes that I hope, with the help of others ( you :-) ) to grow in to a useful, friendly and well written
API to abstract the complexity of X509 and related PKI requirements and specifications.   I also hope to de-mystify 
PKI and make it less of a 'dark art' and so I aim to add a lot of documentation and references.    I am very open to critiscism 
and suggestion from anyone and welcome input from those more knowledge than me ... especially on the security side.
